			<p>We have begun working on the development of the HANDBOOK of Turboprop Flight Simulator, which in its final form will be an open-access document consisting of information about all aspects of the game including airports, vehicles, aircrafts, islands, systems, and more.</p>
			<p>This however is a group project; and demands input and contribution of the game's community. Therefore, we take this opportunity to invite you to join us in the creation of this handbook. All development is taking place in our Discord server. Join us to contribute!</p>
